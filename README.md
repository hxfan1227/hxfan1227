## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am currently working as a __*Research assistant*__ in __*Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limonology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (NIGLAS)*__ in the field of physical geography , *i.e.*, water quality modelling, hydrodynamics, tracer-hydrology, *etc.* in Nanjing, China.  

- Additionally, I am also a __*Honorary visiting scholar*__, working with Prof. [Adrian Werner](https://www.flinders.edu.au/people/adrian.werner) on surface-groundwater interaction related projects in __*Flinders University*__.  

- I have developed a few _**R**_ packages (_e.g._,&nbsp;[SGDr](https://hxfan1227.github.io/SGDr), [efdcr](https://hxfan1227.github.io/efdcr/)). Although most of them are personal use solely, hopefully some will be helpful.

- Please have a look at my complete [_curriculum vitae_](https://hxfan1227.github.io/curriculum-vitae/) and [homepage](https://hxfan1227.github.io/).
